"""
The scope of this project is to be abel to download either a video from YouTube, either only the audio for that video (used for music)
To be more effective, this will have the ability to download either one video at a time, either an entire playlist

When we will dowload the entire playlist, most likely I will implement some sort of multithreading to work faster
